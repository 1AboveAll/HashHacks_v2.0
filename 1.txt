The things we have done so far:
 One of the resident can create an event, he can upload images , select date using datepicker,time using timepicker and his current location would be obtained and the address would be shown.
 The event would basically of community cleaning ,and the members can join the clean India event for the repective locality.
 We have made some interactive ui designs for the home page,and the event creation page.
 At the final pitch what we plan to do:
 A product where a volunteer can create events, observe nearby events, join them and they would be given incentive for that(points based scores). We are planning to use image recogonition api of Microsoft coiginitive which would give tags and if the tag shows dirty the issue would be reported to the mayor. When the area is extremely dirty ( the dirty and garbage tags would only be there if it is really dirty),then mayor would get to know about it.

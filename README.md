Idea-  We are working on the health theme ,and making an organised system for cleaning. We are planning for community cleaning an
reporting the issue to the government if the area is significantly dirty. A volunteer from each locality would share images of his/her locality where the area is dirty and it would be shared to all the members of the community who can all volunteer to clean the place,the concept known as community cleaning. 
We would use image recognition api and hence the tags would be there ,if the area is really dirty and the tags show it to be so than the issue would be reported to the government(mayors) ,mayors having the responsibilty of cleaning it. The people can themselves choose a day for collectively coming and cleaning it.The organiser or the volunteer who uploades images of the locality would get to know all those who are interested to come and clean the locality.
Mantaining cleanliness would enable people to be disease free, and keep them away from diseases like respiratory allergies, mosquito-borne diseases(like malaria,dangue and chikunguniya).
"One way who mantains cleanliness keeps away diseases"
